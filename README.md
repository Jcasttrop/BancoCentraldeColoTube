# BancoCentraldeColoTube

This project aims to implement a banking system using Python, PostgreSQL and various tools that allow me to train for a "full stack data scientist" exercise where I must create from the database, the backend and frontend of the service as well as an automatic data analysis system (pipeline) that uses the database.
